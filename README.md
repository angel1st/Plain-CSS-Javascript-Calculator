Plain CSS & JavaScript Calculator
======================

Description:
Plain CSS & JavaScript calculator. Not using eval function due to possible security issues. Not using any external css and/or JavaScript libraries.

Key aspects:
- User Experience - user can use both keyboard and mouse. First two line shows: 1) calculation string 2) collapsed calculation (if available).
- Ease of implementation - just include js & css files. Add <div id="calculator"></div> and you are ready to go. See calc.html example file.
- Reusability & Extensibility - complete OOP approach. Could be easily extended with additional operations.
